# Classification-Models-to-predict-rainfall

"The Daily Buzz" began as a small newspaper company with a mission to provide accurate and trustworthy news to the people of Sydney. Over the years, it evolved into one of the city's most respected news sources. However, facing tough competition, the team decided to innovate and launched "The Weather Oracle."

This GitHub project explores how we leveraged the power of machine learning with Python in Jupyter Notebook to improve weather predictions. Equipped with state-of-the-art technology and a team of experienced meteorologists, we introduced precise and reliable weather forecasts to our readers.

In this project, you'll dive into the machine learning model for rainfall prediction that we developed, understanding its working and how it has enhanced the accuracy of our weather forecasts. Join us as we unravel the magic behind "The Weather Oracle" and its impact on community planning and decision-making.
